# Learning objectives

In this course, you learn about Hyperledger Composer and other tools that you can use to interact with a blockchain network. You'll also learn about the components of a typical blockchain solution, such as ledgers, smart contracts, peer networks, and wallets. Finally, you'll see what the key responsibilities are for blockchain developers and administrators.

When you finish this course, you should understand:

- The structure and benefits of using Hyperledger Composer, which is an open source project and a suite of high-level abstractions for business networks
- How to use Hyperledger Composer to model and build a simple business network
- The components and structure of Hyperledger Fabric, which is a blockchain framework that uses containers to host smart contracts called chaincode that comprise the application logic of the system
- Blockchain solution components, such as wallets, ledgers, participants, consensus, security, and smart contracts
- How to write a simple application to query a sample network and how to build a network from scratch
- Key considerations and responsibilities of those who help to build, model, run, and maintain a blockchain business network:
- Developers
- Administrators
- Methods to arrive at consensus
- Tools and applications that you can use to interact with the network
