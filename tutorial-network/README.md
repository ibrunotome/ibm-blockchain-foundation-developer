# Lab 1: Create a Hyperledger Composer solution

In this lab, you use Hyperledger Composer to model a blockchain solution from scratch and create a sample Angular 2-based application that interacts with a blockchain network. Composer helps you model and test networks based on your own use cases.

This lab can take several hours to complete.

You must install Hyperledger Composer, Docker, and other software. See Installing the development environment.
